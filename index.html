    <h1>The Norm and the Exceptions</h1>
    <div>In the text it tries to sum up exploring data as the act of finding patterns in the data and observing differences within those patterns. While this is a simple way of putting this it is a really effective way of putting it. All data has 3 important <b>measures of central tendency</b>, the Mean, Median, and Mode. Mode being the most occuring value, median being the middle value and mean being the average value. These are great predictors to create expectations for all forms of data plot and thinking what would be normal. They allow us to draw conclusions from the data and determine what would be considered normal for certain events. From these events there will always be the few exceptions, or what the text describes as <b>"Outliers."</b> These are pieces of data that are far too out of place to be considered the "Norm," due to them being very different from the majority of the data presented. Like if the data was centered around the number 2, but one piece of data was around the number 7, that would be classified as an outlier. These outliers also back us away from using the Mean to determine the Norm and the Range, the range isn't used primarily to determine data normalities but is still important to observing our data.</div>
